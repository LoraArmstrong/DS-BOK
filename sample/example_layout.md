## Researcher's voice

The project aims to create inclusive and resilient dwelling clusters for urban resettlement in Kathmandu (Nepal) and establish a living lab model to develop transparent and integrated methodology of analysis, planning and design. This project will 
- Employ a participatory planning and design approach and survey and map social and spatial living patterns of residents from different urban conditions (traditional neighborhood, slum, urban resettlement). 
- Support a new MSc studio: master students will carry out field research to the project, as part of their study
- Collaborate with practitioners: research outcome as pilot project for local development

## Data perspective


### Data collection

In this project, the research team expect to collect the following types of data: 
- terrain data: 
  - drone images
  - maps of the area
  - other land survey information
- interview data
  - audio recording
  - interview notes
  - transcripts of the interviews



### Ethics perspective

Given the nature of the target population (resettelment policies), it is considered in this project, that participants from the general population is a ``risk'' population. 
The interview data is to be collected by the research team, but only aggregated information would be shared beyond the initial core team. 

Because the research takes place in a foreign country, specific arrangements must be put in place to guarantee that the interviewees can provide an ``informed'' consent - the researchers must inform the participants in language they understand. 

It may be that participants are not able/willing to sign forms, nor provide their names. The procedure for collecting consent should be outlined by reviewed by the appropriate committee.
